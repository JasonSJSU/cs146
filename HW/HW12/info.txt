to supply water we can either build a well or a pipe from another well to the house.

we can just represent a well as a pipe with cost equal to cost the cost of build a well.

then we can just add them all into a sorted list to pick the cheapest pipes.

Use union find to track connected parts, as pipes get added we union the components and prevent cycles and make sure pipes for a tree like path which
will ensure we get the cheapest possible option.

as we union components we add the cost to a min cost var and return this as our solution.
