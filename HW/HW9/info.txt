we first check for empty tree.

we know 
if both p and q are smaller than root, LCA lies in left subtree
if both p and q are greater than root, LCA lies in right subtree
if one of p or q is on one side and the other is on the other side, root is the LCA

so we can call lowestCommonAncestor function recursively to either child if the 'root' variable is not the LCA yet until the 'root' node has p and q on different sides.

then return the node of 'root'
