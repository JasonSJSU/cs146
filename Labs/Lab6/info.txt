with each course being a nod an a prereq being a directed edge we can tell if you can complete all courses based on if there is a cycle or not.
if there is a cycle then you cannot complete all courses otherwise u can.

we use an adjacency list to represent the course and prereqs as a directed graph
we use dfs to detect if there are cycles. we have a visted array to track if the state of each node of if they are visted or not.
0 meants not visted
1 means currently visited and is part of the current dfs call stack
2 means completely visited

we perform a dfs on nodes that are yet unvisited. if we find a node is currently being visted and visted[node] == 1 then there is a cycle
otherwise we mark as completely visted.

whenever we run into a cycle we turn false and otherwise true.
