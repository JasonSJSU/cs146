first we check for empty tree.

then we check starting from the root node if it follows BST with its left child's value being lower than the parent node and the right child's value
being higher the parent node. return false if it fails this check.

then recursively apply for this BST property on the children and continue until the entire tree is checked. after every node is checked
return true.
